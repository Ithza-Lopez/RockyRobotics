#Robot Simulation
#This code simulates a robot that hovers over a block, reaches down for it, touches it, and moves it over to a specified position in rainbow order.

#Robot Grasp
#This code simulates a robot that hovers over a block, reaches down for it, and grips it in between the grippers. It then sets it back down in its original location.

#Limitations
#We were forced to hard code the positions of the blocks for the Robot simulation because we were not able to get the robot to grab blocks at different specified locations. The positions and colors of the blocks are defined in the color_dict dictionary. We also hard coded the movements of the robot and blocks as they travel to the sorted position. The simulated robot touches down on the blocks, the block disappears and reappears at the specified location that will put the blocks in rainbow order along with the robot gripper.
